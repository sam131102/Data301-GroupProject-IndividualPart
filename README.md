## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With this analytics project we are looking forward to improve our skills in python and how to use python for data analysis, also this data set is useful for professional FIFA players. We are interested in this dataset because we are really into FIFA as we love the game of football and we grew up watching it. From this data set we would like to asses different factors about the highest rated players in the game like, whether or not the pay of a player depends on the position he plays; (for example: whether forward players are paid generally more than defenders). For this project, we see ourselves creating a whole working, user-facing dashboard with this dataset as it would be a good way of summarizing, tracking, and organising the data for users. It can also be useful to display the data in an elegant way.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data set my team agreed on is the FIFA 21 dataset. After brainstorming for some time, we found common ground at football and hence, chose the game FIFA 21 as we all found the dataset for this project to be perfect. This data set contains data about every player in the game FIFA 21 and was released in October 2020. The data set contains data of factors like, players' ratings, their age, their nationality, the position that they play in and their potential for growth in game. The purpose of our project is to give other players who are passionate about FIFA a detailed analysis about all of the players for them to make the right choice to create their perfect team. The data values in the data were collected from (fifaindex.com) and were compiled by Aayush Mishra, to whom all the credits go.
